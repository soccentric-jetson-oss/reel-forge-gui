# Reel Forge GUI — Video Processing Desktop Application

The Reel Forge GUI is a cross-platform PySide6 desktop application for controlling the Jetson AGX Orin's hardware video encode and decode capabilities. It provides a clean interface with buttons to start and stop H.264 encode and decode jobs at 1080p resolution, with real-time status display showing active job counts and bytes processed. The application connects to the Reel Forge gRPC server and features automatic status refresh every 3 seconds. The simple, focused interface makes it easy to quickly start and stop video processing jobs while monitoring throughput.
